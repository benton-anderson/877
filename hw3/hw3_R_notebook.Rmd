This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


# Problem 1 
# 1. Two group comparison: Apply EBSeq to the PBMC data to determine the number of genes differentially expressed (DE) between the two conditions.
#        1. How many genes are DE at false discovery rate (FDR) 5% and 10%? (3 pts)
#        2. What are the estimated library size factors? What information do they provide? (3 pts)
#        3. Does the model fit well as assessed via diagnostics? Please show diagnostic plots and discuss. (3 pts)
